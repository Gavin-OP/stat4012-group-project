The following is PCA analysis on 8 zero rate daily changes, daily data from July 2000 to Aug 2011


```{r}
## input raw data: daily zero rates
dataset=read.csv("/Users/zhangpuming/Desktop/time_series/raw_data_adjusted.csv",header=T)
dataset = na.omit(dataset)
x=dataset[ ,!(colnames(dataset) %in% c('date'))]
head(x)

```


```{r}
## Get the daily changes of zero rates, calculate correlation matrix and means
xdiff=apply(x,2,diff)
head(xdiff)
cor(xdiff)
apply(xdiff,2,mean)
```
```{r}
## PCA analysis on xdiff
out=princomp(xdiff)
summary(out)
out$loadings[,1:3]
```
