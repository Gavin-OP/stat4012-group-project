Overview:
To synthesize profitable trading strategies, the key issue is to accurately predict the future stock price.
There are mainly three approaches to make the predication:
1) Cross-sectional regressions (OLS)
   cons: low accuracy due to the violation of OLS assumptions
2) Time series models   (eg ARIMA)
   cons: don't work well on volatile data
3) Machine learning models  -> Higher accuracy even for volatile data

Our goal:
Compare the predication accuracy of CNN and LSTM algorithms and find the optimal model to conduct multivariate time series forecasting

Data:
A single stock/ETF's historical pricing data (High Low Open Close Volume) for one year(?), at 5 mins interval(?) 

Logistic:
Use High, Low, Close, Volume data as regressors(features) and use Open data as response 

Hyperparameters:
0. number of layers
1. number of neurons in each layer
2. batch size
3. activation function
4. optimizer

Evaluating measures:
accuracy and generalization error

Steps:
0. collect data
1. preprocessing data: calculate returns and convert it into stationary sequence
